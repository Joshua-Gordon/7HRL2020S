No shops, ship is sufficient
World type is either the map or the menu
    Menu has scrollbar parametrised by length, current position
Hull is health. Start at 100
Ship requires power, die if no power Start at 100
Heat bad, start at 0, limit is 100. Damage over time over a threshold
Heat threshold starts at 20
Gain heat each tick from uranium / 2
Gain heat from drilling things greater than drill limit, limit starts at 60
    heat_added = (hardness - limit)/5
Lose heat per tick equal to radiator value, start at 1
If you start your turn with x heat above threshold, take x damage and lose x/2 heat

Hardness of stone is min(100,100*(perlin + 1)/2 + other_constant * depth)

Ore gen:
	If hardness >= 70 and ore_perlin >= 60 then it will be ore
		x / 8 xor y / 8 -> seed a generator with that
		and then find the apropriate ore based on weights

Inventory cap starts at 40.
If you hit cap on uranium you fission
